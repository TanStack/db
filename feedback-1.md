- High – The proposed core API drops the `Transaction` surface returned by `createTransaction`; `mutate` is shown as `void` with only a `cleanup()` companion (`SERIALIZED_TRANSACTION_PLAN.md:95`). Without propagating the `Transaction` object (or at least its `isPersisted` promise/error handling), callers lose the only way to await persistence or detect failures, which is central to today’s transaction workflow. Please plan to surface the existing `Transaction` or equivalent signals instead of returning bare callbacks.

- High – The React hook sketch keeps a stale strategy instance: it creates `strategyRef` but never reads it, and `useMemo` ignores `config.strategy` in its dependency array (`SERIALIZED_TRANSACTION_PLAN.md:234`). Any consumer that swaps strategies (or mutates strategy options) would continue using the first instance and never trigger the tear-down path. The plan should either require stable strategy instances or include strategy in the memo/effect dependencies and actually dispose/recreate when it changes.

- Medium – The Angular deliverable is listed as `useSerializedTransaction.ts`, but the Angular package currently follows the `inject…` pattern (`packages/angular-db/src/index.ts` exports `injectLiveQuery`). Shipping a `use`-prefixed API would stick out and miss Angular’s DI guards; please align the plan with the existing injection-based naming/structure (`SERIALIZED_TRANSACTION_PLAN.md:84`).

- Medium – The strategy example imports `Debouncer` via the `@tanstack/pacer/debouncer` subpath (`SERIALIZED_TRANSACTION_PLAN.md:266`), but Pacer’s public API is bundled behind its main entry points. Depending on subpath files risks breaking when the package layout shifts. I’d recommend validating the actual export surface (likely `import { createDebouncer } from '@tanstack/pacer'`) before committing to this shape.

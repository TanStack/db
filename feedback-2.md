- High â€“ The Solid deliverable name still conflicts with the core export. `packages/solid-db/src/index.ts` re-exports `createSerializedTransaction` from `@tanstack/db`, so shipping a Solid wrapper with the same name (`createSerializedTransaction(config)` in the plan) will cause the barrel to re-export the identifier twice and TypeScript will emit TS2308. Please rename the Solid-specific helper or stop re-exporting the core helper from the Solid package to avoid the collision.

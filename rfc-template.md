Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough RFC based on this PRD. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed RFC for an engineer to start prototyping. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. We should especially press for where there's high certainty about what to do and where there's remaining ambiguity or uncertainty to resolve through prototyping and further research.

The sections of the RFC are:

## Summary
A single-paragraph context-problem-solution summary. The goal is to make the purpose click for the reader. (It’s usually best to write this as a final step of writing the RFC.)

## Background
Just enough context necessary to frame the rest of the RFC. The content should be indisputable facts, not opinion.

## Problem
A description of the problem that this RFC is trying to address, the constraints, and why this problem is worth solving now.

## Proposal
Detailed proposal for how to implement the PRD.

## Definition of success
How do we know if this proposal was successful?

---

Please write this RFC using precise, direct language that clearly communicates product specifications and vision. Replace abstract business terminology with concrete descriptions of functionality, user needs, and technical details. Use specific metrics rather than buzzwords when describing goals or success criteria. Structure information logically with descriptive headings rather than trendy frameworks. When technical terms are necessary, define them plainly. The document should feel authoritative and thorough without resorting to corporate clichés or inflated language.

Once done with the discussion, write the RFC section by section so I can review it as we go.

Remember, only one question at a time.

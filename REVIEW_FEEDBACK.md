# Review Feedback

- Blocking – `.preload()` now hangs when the initial sync errors (`packages/electric-db-collection/src/electric.ts:655`). We removed the `markReady()` call in the stream `onError` handler and now just rethrow. Unfortunately, `CollectionSyncManager.preload()` (`packages/db/src/collection/sync.ts:203`) only resolves once `markReady()` is triggered and never rejects later if the lifecycle flips to `error`. So if the first sync attempt fails and the user hasn’t provided a custom `shapeOptions.onError`, any `await collection.preload()` will wait forever. Could we either reinstate the ready transition or wire the lifecycle into an error path that causes `preload()` to reject (e.g. keep a resolver/rejector registered on `status:error`)?
- Suggestion – if you decide to push the lifecycle into `error` after a timeout, make sure `preload()` can observe that state change. Right now it registers only `onFirstReady`, so it still wouldn’t unblock unless we also reject when `status:error` fires.

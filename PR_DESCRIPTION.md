# PR Title

Add stable viewKey API to prevent UI re-renders during ID transitions

---

# PR Body

## Summary

Fixes #19

Adds built-in support for stable view keys that prevent UI flicker when optimistic inserts transition from temporary IDs to real server-generated IDs.

## The Problem

When inserting items with temporary IDs (e.g., negative numbers) that are later replaced by real server IDs, React treats the key change as a component identity shift, causing:

1. **UI Flicker** - Components unmount and remount, resetting state
2. **Lost Focus** - Input fields lose focus during ID transition
3. **Visual Jank** - Animations restart, scroll position resets

Previously, developers had to manually maintain an external mapping from IDs to stable keys.

## The Solution

Collections can now be configured with a `viewKey` function to automatically generate and track stable keys:

```typescript
const todoCollection = createCollection({
  getKey: (item) => item.id,
  viewKey: () => crypto.randomUUID(), // ← Auto-generate stable keys
  onInsert: async ({ transaction }) => {
    const tempId = transaction.mutations[0].modified.id
    const response = await api.create(...)

    // Link temp ID to real ID - they share the same viewKey
    todoCollection.mapViewKey(tempId, response.id)
    await todoCollection.utils.refetch()
  },
})

// Use stable keys in React - no more flicker!
{todos.map((todo) => (
  <li key={todoCollection.getViewKey(todo.id)}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
))}
```

## API

### New Configuration Option

- **`viewKey?: (item: T) => string`** - Function to generate stable view keys for inserted items

### New Collection Methods

- **`getViewKey(key: TKey): string`** - Returns stable viewKey for any key (temporary or real). Falls back to `String(key)` if no viewKey is configured.

- **`mapViewKey(tempKey: TKey, realKey: TKey): void`** - Links temporary and real IDs to share the same stable viewKey

### Type Changes

- Added `viewKey?: string` to `PendingMutation` interface
- Added `viewKey?: string` to `ChangeMessage` interface

## Implementation Details

1. **Storage**: Added `viewKeyMap: Map<TKey, string>` to `CollectionStateManager` to track stable keys
2. **Generation**: ViewKeys are automatically generated during `insert()` if configured
3. **Linking**: `mapViewKey()` creates bidirectional mapping from both temp and real IDs to the same viewKey
4. **Events**: All change events (insert/update/delete) now include viewKey for subscribers
5. **Persistence**: ViewKeys kept indefinitely (tiny memory overhead ~50 bytes per item)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible** - All changes are opt-in:
- Collections without `viewKey` config work exactly as before
- `getViewKey()` returns `String(key)` when no viewKey is configured
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

## Documentation

Updated `/docs/guides/mutations.md` to replace the manual workaround with the new built-in API, including:
- Complete usage example
- How it works explanation
- Best practices

## Design Decisions

1. **Opt-in via configuration** - Only active when explicitly enabled
2. **Function instead of object** - Simple `viewKey: () => uuid()` instead of `{ generate: () => uuid() }`
3. **Explicit linking** - Manual `mapViewKey()` call for reliability (vs auto-detection which would be fragile)
4. **Collection-level storage** - ViewKeys stored in collection metadata, not polluting item data
5. **Indefinite retention** - Mappings kept forever for consistency (negligible memory impact)

## Testing

Manual testing performed with temporary-to-real ID transitions. Automated tests can be added as a follow-up if desired.

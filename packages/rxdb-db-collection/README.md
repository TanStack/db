## About RxDB

RxDB (Reactive Database) is a local-first, NoSQL-database for JavaScript Applications. It is reactive, meaning that you can query the current state and subscribe to all state changes, e.g. for realtime UI updates.

Key features include:
- [Local-First](https://rxdb.info/articles/local-first-future.html): Data is stored locally on the client for instant access and works offline.
- [Replication](https://rxdb.info/replication.html): Built-in replication protocols to sync with your backend.
- **Multi-Tab Support**: Syncs data between browser tabs and windows.
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures your data matches your JSON schema.

### Patch Changes

- Add initial release of TrailBase collection for TanStack DB. TrailBase is a blazingly fast, open-source alternative to Firebase built on Rust, SQLite, and V8. It provides type-safe REST and realtime APIs with sub-millisecond latencies, integrated authentication, and flexible access control - all in a single executable. This collection type enables seamless integration with TrailBase backends for high-performance real-time applications. ([#228](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/228))
